 * Notes: This is a storage mechanism for a window of payload buffers in a 
 *      Go Back N protocol. It is used for either a receiver or sender window
 *      and some specific functions (as indicated) will only be used by the
 *      EITHER sender OR the receiver. If we were using C++, I could have 
 *      abstracted and sub-classed all this, but unfortunately that is not the
 *      case. Comments will indicate where appropriate.
